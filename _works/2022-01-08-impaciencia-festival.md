There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. Albums are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of photographs, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is stamp albums, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of postage stamps. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).

The event was born from the creation of the Impatience project, which hosts the first competition for the best research projects developed by multidisciplinary teams of university students. It is thus an Atalaya project promoted by the Junta de Andalucía and coordinated by the University of Malaga.

It also has the collaboration and participation of the universities of Granada, Seville, Cordoba, Cadiz and Huelva, in addition to the support of a number of expert entities in various disciplines such as robotics, new technologies, digital art, biology or OpenSource culture, among others.

With an endowment of 2000 and 1000 euros respectively, the winning teams of the contest were The Open Bacteria Project (Best Impatience Project), B-tech (Mention to the best technical project), La Croqueta Educativa (Mention to the best theoretical project) and The Open Bacteria Project (Mention to the best communicative project). All of them stood out for their originality, consistency and projection. 

Likewise, the festival also offered its attendees the opportunity to enjoy activities such as stands (OpenLab Madrid, Innovart, Málaga MakerSpace...), games, music, FoodTrucks, talks, performances, presentations, exhibitions, concerts and workshops on a wide range of topics in a fun and entertaining atmosphere.

Hundreds of people enjoyed this day thanks to the invaluable efforts of volunteers and the support of La Térmica, Rupture Events, Fundación Descubre, Encuentros con la Ciencia, Victoria and tiendaUMA. As well as thanks to the collaboration of the Faculty of Science, FablabUS, Hacklab Almería, Guadatech, Openlab Madrid, Makerspace Málaga, GDG Málaga, Transdisciplina A/V, Pybonacci, Pitech, Innovart, Databeers Málaga, Lex Ludi Malacitana, Ana Albarracín and Pymiento Project.

Impaciencia goes a step further and extends throughout the year in the form of conferences, a research project competition and online courses.
