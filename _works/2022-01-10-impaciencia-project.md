"Impaciencia" (Impatient) is a contest that will reward the best research projects developed by multidisciplinary teams of university students. As a good contest you can win prizes, credits, friends (or lose them) and have an unforgettable experience.

These research projects can deal with any topic: the flow of people at the bus stops in your city, the salivation of your dog when bringing food, how good it is for your plants to listen to Deltoya by Extremoduro,.... Whatever, the limit is set by your imagination.

The projects submitted must be documented in github repositories under a CC BY license. This way you will always be recognized as the authors and also other people anywhere in the world will be able to use them in their own research, classes, exhibitions or as a starting point for future projects. This way we make sure that all the effort you have made does not rot in a drawer and that it can be used to improve education.

The Impaciencia project, in collaboration with the Library of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Malaga, makes available to the entire university community of the UMA the first Technoteca. A service that makes available to all students the loan of electronic prototyping boards Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

> These devices are easy to use and very versatile. So much so that they are used daily all over the world to build everything from low-cost scientific instruments to robots to interactive art installations. The vast majority of these projects are described on the internet so anyone with access to the boards can re-create them without having to be an electronics or computer expert.

Students will be able to purchase the boards at the library in a similar way as they would a book on deposit. All they have to do is go to the counter and request one of the devices. The University of Malaga thus becomes one of the first institutions to offer this service completely free of charge to any university student and to allow its use outside the university facilities.
